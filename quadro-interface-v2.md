# Aquacomputer Quadro Interface Notes

This document describes the Quadro USB interface details currently known well
enough to build command line tools for basic Linux and Windows control.

The interface is not vendor-documented here. Treat every write as hardware
control: read first, validate CRCs, change the smallest possible set of bytes,
write a backup, and verify the device accepted the exact intended values.

## Device Identity

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| USB vendor ID | `0x0c70` |
| Quadro product ID | `0xf00d` |
| Known firmware | `1033` |
| Example serial | `00725-60872` |
| Example raw serial | `0x02d5edc8` |

Serial text is encoded like the existing plugin:

```text
upper = (serial_raw >> 16) & 0xffff
lower = serial_raw & 0xffff
serial_text = f"{upper:05d}-{lower:05d}"
```

The USB device exposes at least these interfaces:

| Interface | Class | Endpoints | Use |
| ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | vendor-specific `ff/00/00` | bulk `0x81`, `0x02` | Used by aquasuite for some runtime/soft-sensor traffic. Not needed for basic autonomous fan control. |
| 1 | HID `03/00/00` | interrupt IN `0x83` | Live readings and HID feature/output reports. |

For a cross-platform Python CLI, use HID APIs rather than Linux-only `hidraw`
where practical. `hidapi`/`hid` should make Windows support mostly transparent
for feature reports, while Linux `hidraw` is useful for low-level diagnostics.

## Byte Order And Scaling

All multi-byte numeric fields seen so far are big-endian.

Use these helpers consistently:

| Type | Encoding |
| --- | --- |
| `u16be` | unsigned 16-bit big-endian |
| `s16be` | signed 16-bit big-endian |
| `u32be` | unsigned 32-bit big-endian |

Common scales:

| Quantity | Raw scale |
| --- | --- |
| Temperature | Celsius x 100 |
| Fan/controller output | Percent x 100 |
| Fan voltage | Volts x 100 |
| Missing temperature | `32767` sentinel |

## CRC

Settings and names reports end with a big-endian CRC-16/USB checksum over the
payload only. The HID report ID byte and final two CRC bytes are not included in
the calculation.

CRC parameters:

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Width | 16 |
| Poly | `0x8005` |
| Init | `0xffff` |
| XorOut | `0xffff` |
| RefIn | true |
| RefOut | true |

Equivalent Python implementation:

```python
def crc16_usb(data: bytes) -> int:
    crc = 0xFFFF
    for byte in data:
        crc ^= byte
        for _ in range(8):
            if crc & 1:
                crc = (crc >> 1) ^ 0xA001
            else:
                crc >>= 1
            crc &= 0xFFFF
    return crc ^ 0xFFFF
```

## Report Summary

| Report | Direction | Length | Purpose |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| Input report `0x01` | device to host, interrupt IN | 220 | Live device, temperature, fan, controller, alarm, and profile readings. |
| Feature report `0x03` | bidirectional HID feature | 961 | Main persistent settings. |
| Output report `0x02` | host to device HID output | 11 | Commit/apply packet used after settings writes. |
| Feature report `0x08` | bidirectional HID feature | 1013 | Names/labels and related flash data. |

Low-level HID control request identities:

| Operation | bmRequestType | bRequest | wValue | wIndex | wLength |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ---: | ---: |
| Get settings feature report `0x03` | `0xa1` | `0x01` | `0x0303` | 1 | 1013 requested, 961 returned |
| Set settings feature report `0x03` | `0x21` | `0x09` | `0x0303` | 1 | 961 |
| Set output report `0x02` | `0x21` | `0x09` | `0x0202` | 1 | 11 |
| Set names feature report `0x08` | `0x21` | `0x09` | `0x0308` | 1 | 1013 |

Known commit/output report bytes:

```text
02 00 00 00 02 00 00 00 00 34 c6
```

For settings changes, the safest sequence is:

1. Read feature report `0x03`.
2. Require length at least 961 and report ID byte `0x03`.
3. Validate CRC over bytes `1..958` against bytes `959..960`.
4. Save the original report as a binary backup.
5. Apply the minimal intended edits.
6. Recompute CRC into bytes `959..960`.
7. Write feature report `0x03`.
8. Write output report `0x02` commit bytes.
9. Read feature report `0x03` again and verify the edited fields.
10. Optionally read live input report `0x01` to verify runtime behavior.

On Linux `hidraw`, feature reads may be requested with a 1013-byte buffer even
though settings report `0x03` returns 961 bytes. On Windows through `hidapi`,
the same logical operation should be `get_feature_report(0x03, 1013)`.

## Live Input Report `0x01`

Input report `0x01` is 220 bytes long. Absolute offsets below include the

```

## Settings Feature Report `0x03`

Feature report `0x03` is 961 bytes:

```text
byte 0      report ID, 0x03
bytes 1-958 settings payload
bytes 959-960 CRC-16/USB over bytes 1-958, big-endian
```

All offsets in this section are payload-relative. Add 1 for absolute HID report
offsets.

### Top-Level Layout

| Payload Offset | Type | Field |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| 0 | `u16be` | Structure ID |
| 2 | `u8` | I2C address |
| 3 | `u16be` | Device flags |

| 53 | `ControllerConfig[4]` | Fan controller settings, 85 bytes each |
| 393 | `StripConfig` | RGBpx/strip config |
| 396 | `LedControllerConfig[8]` | LED controller settings, 70 bytes each |
| 956 | `u8` | Profile ID |
| 957 | `u8` | Dummy/padding |

### Temperature Sensor Config

`SensorConfig` is 2 bytes:

| Entry Offset | Type | Field |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| 0 | `s16be` | Offset, Celsius x 100 |

Sensor config base:

```text
sensor_base(index0) = 9 + index0 * 2
```

Example: writing `368` to sensor 1 offset means `+3.68 C`.

### Fan Config

`FanConfig` is 9 bytes:

| Entry Offset | Type | Field |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| 0 | `u8` | Fan config flags |
| 1 | `s16be` | Minimum power, percent x 100 |
| 3 | `s16be` | Maximum power, percent x 100 |
| 5 | `s16be` | Fallback power, percent x 100 |
| 7 | `s16be` | Maximum RPM |

Fan config base:

```text
fan_config_base(index0) = 17 + index0 * 9
```

Known fan config flags:

| Bit | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `0x01` | Hold minimum power |
| `0x02` | Start boost |

Important tachless/high-current fan note: with a powered bypass adapter and no
working tach signal, start boost can leave the live fan output at `100.00%`
even when the controller is configured for a lower fixed output. For this setup,
clear `0x02` on the relevant `FanConfig.flags`.

Known examples:

| Raw | Decoded |
| ---: | --- |
| `2184` | `21.84%` |
| `7920` | `79.20%` |
| `7111` | `71.11%` |

### Controller Config

`ControllerConfig` is 85 bytes:

| Entry Offset | Type | Field |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| 0 | `u8` | Mode |
| 1 | `s16be` | Fixed/manual power, percent x 100 |
| 3 | `s16be` | Source sensor index |
| 5 | `PidConfig` | Target-temperature controller, 14 bytes |
| 19 | `CurveConfig` | Curve controller, 66 bytes |

Controller config base:

```text
controller_base(index0) = 53 + index0 * 85
```

Known modes:

| Value | Meaning |
| ---: | --- |
| `0` | Fixed power / power preset |
| `1` | Target-temperature controller |
| `2` | Curve controller |
| `4` | Use or mirror another fan controller's settings |

Known source values:

| Value | Meaning |
| ---: | --- |
| `-1` | No source / unused, common in fixed-power configs |
| `0` | Temperature Sensor 1 |
| `1` | Temperature Sensor 2 |

Fan 1 fixed-power fields:

```text
payload[53]       controller[0].mode
payload[54..55]   controller[0].power
payload[17]       fan_config[0].flags
```

To set Fan 1 to fixed 50% for a tachless bypass fan:

```text
controller[0].mode = 0
controller[0].power = 5000
fan_config[0].flags &= ~0x02
```

Then recompute the settings CRC, write report `0x03`, send output report `0x02`,
and read back report `0x03` to verify.

### PID Config

`PidConfig` is 14 bytes:

| Entry Offset | Type | Field |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| 0 | `s16be` | Setpoint, Celsius x 100 |
| 2 | `s16be` | P gain |
| 4 | `s16be` | I gain |
| 6 | `s16be` | D gain |
| 8 | `s16be` | D-Tn |
| 10 | `s16be` | Hysteresis, Celsius x 100 |
| 12 | `u16be` | PID flags |

PID base:

```text
pid_base(index0) = controller_base(index0) + 5
```

Known examples:

| Field | Example Value | Meaning |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Setpoint | `5000` | `50.00 C` |
| Hysteresis | `10` | `0.10 C` |
| P/I/D/D-Tn preset | `2500`, `2000`, `500`, `10` | A known "faster +1" style preset |
| User-defined P/I/D | `1419`, `1205`, `2` | Known user-defined values |

### Curve Config

`CurveConfig` is 66 bytes:

| Entry Offset | Type | Field |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| 0 | `s16be` | Start value, Celsius x 100 |
| 2 | `s16be[16]` | Curve input temperatures, Celsius x 100 |
| 34 | `s16be[16]` | Curve output powers, percent x 100 |

Curve base:

```text
curve_base(index0) = controller_base(index0) + 19
curve_input(index0, point0) = curve_base(index0) + 2 + point0 * 2
curve_output(index0, point0) = curve_base(index0) + 34 + point0 * 2
```

Known example: point 8 changed from `33.20 C -> 33.37 C` and
`22.60% -> 40.22%`, represented as raw input `3320 -> 3337` and raw output
`2260 -> 4022`.

### Strip Config

Known strip fields:

| Payload Offset | Type | Field |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| 393 | `u8` | Brightness |
| 394 | `u16be` | Strip flags |

Known examples:

| Field | Raw | Meaning |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Brightness | `255` | Full brightness |
| Brightness | `252` | Slightly reduced brightness |
| Strip flags | `0x0002` | Strip disabled |

### LED Controller Config

Eight LED controller entries start at payload offset `396`, with a 70-byte
stride:

```text
led_controller_base(index0) = 396 + index0 * 70
```

The plugin has a partial structure for these entries, but they are not required
for basic fan and temperature-sensor CLI functionality.

## Names Feature Report `0x08`

Feature report `0x08` is 1013 bytes:

```text
byte 0        report ID, 0x08
bytes 1-1010  names/flash payload
bytes 1011-1012 CRC-16/USB over bytes 1-1010, big-endian
```

Payload layout:

| Payload Offset | Type | Field |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| 0 | `u16be` | Version/structure ID |
| 2 | `Name[42]` | Null-terminated ASCII names, 24 bytes each |

Name slot base:

```text
name_base(slot0) = 2 + slot0 * 24
```

Known slots:

| Slot | Name |
| ---: | --- |
| 0 | Unknown/reserved |
| 1-4 | Fan 1-4 |
| 9-16 | LED Controller 1-8 |
| 17 | Flow |
| 18-21 | Temperature Sensor 1-4 |
| 24 | Strip |
| 25-40 | Software sensors |

Renaming fans, sensors, LED controllers, the strip, and software sensors changes
report `0x08`, not settings report `0x03`.

## Aquasuite XML Profile Backups

Aquasuite profile XML files can contain base64 fields named `settings` and
`flash`.

Known useful behavior:

| XML Field | Decoded Length | Meaning |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `settings` | 961 | Settings report-compatible bytes, except byte 0 may be `0x00` instead of HID report ID `0x03`. Bytes `1..960` match payload plus CRC format. |
| `flash` | 1013 | Names/flash report `0x08`, including report ID and CRC. |

For tooling, XML backups are useful as import/export sources, but direct device
readback should remain authoritative before writes.

## Vendor Bulk Traffic

The vendor-specific interface has bulk endpoint `0x02` host-to-device traffic.
Some actions that look like runtime-only updates, especially software-sensor
updates, use this path. Known examples include 33-byte and 67-byte bulk OUT
messages.

This is not currently needed for autonomous fan control stored on the Quadro.
Do not build basic persistent fan-control tooling around bulk traffic until the
message format is decoded.

## Suggested Python CLI Design

A practical package layout:

| Module | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `quadro.transport` | Enumerate devices by VID/PID, open HID device, read/write feature reports, read input reports. |
| `quadro.crc` | CRC-16/USB implementation and validation helpers. |
| `quadro.reports` | Typed decoders/encoders for input `0x01`, settings `0x03`, names `0x08`. |
| `quadro.settings` | High-level read-modify-write operations with backups and verification. |
| `quadro.cli` | Argument parsing and user-facing commands. |

Initial subcommands worth implementing:

| Command | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `quadro list` | List matching Quadro HID devices and serials. |
| `quadro status` | Print one decoded live input report. |
| `quadro watch` | Repeatedly print selected live values. |
| `quadro dump-settings` | Read report `0x03`, validate CRC, print decoded settings, optionally save binary. |
| `quadro dump-names` | Read report `0x08`, validate CRC, print names, optionally save binary. |
| `quadro set-fan-power FAN PERCENT` | Set controller mode `0`, fixed power, and optionally clear start boost. |
| `quadro set-fan-limits FAN --min X --max Y --fallback Z --rpm-max N` | Update `FanConfig` limits. |
| `quadro set-fan-flags FAN --start-boost on/off --hold-min-power on/off` | Update known fan flags. |
| `quadro set-sensor-offset SENSOR TEMP_C` | Update temperature sensor offset. |
| `quadro set-target-temp FAN SENSOR TEMP_C` | Set mode `1`, source sensor, and PID setpoint. |
| `quadro set-curve FAN ...` | Set mode `2`, source sensor, and 16 curve points. |
| `quadro rename SLOT NAME` | Update names report `0x08`. |
| `quadro backup` | Save raw reports `0x03` and `0x08`. |
| `quadro restore-settings FILE` | Restore a settings report after validation and explicit confirmation. |

Safety defaults:

| Area | Recommended Default |
| --- | --- |
| Percent writes | Reject values outside `0..100`; optionally require an override below `20%`. |
| Fan 1 fixed-power command for bypass/tachless fans | Clear start boost unless the user passes an explicit keep option. |
| Write commands | Always read current settings first and only modify known offsets. |
| Backups | Save a raw binary backup before every write. |
| Verification | Read back the same report and compare intended fields. |
| CRC mismatch | Refuse to decode or write. |
| Unsupported firmware | Warn loudly, but allow read-only commands. Require an override for writes. |

## Linux Notes

Linux exposes the device as `/dev/hidrawN`. The number changes across reconnects,
so discover it through `/sys/class/hidraw` by matching VID/PID.

Useful permission options:

```bash
sudo setfacl -m u:$USER:rw /dev/hidrawN
```

or a persistent udev rule such as:

```text
SUBSYSTEM=="hidraw", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0c70", ATTRS{idProduct}=="f00d", MODE="0660", TAG+="uaccess"
```

Linux `hidraw` feature-report ioctls:

| Operation | ioctl |
| --- | --- |
| Read feature report | `HIDIOCGFEATURE(len)` |
| Write feature report | `HIDIOCSFEATURE(len)` |

The first byte of the buffer is always the HID report ID.

## Windows Notes

Windows support should mostly live in the transport layer if using `hidapi`.
The encoder/decoder, CRC, scaling, and report layouts should be identical.

Watch for these platform differences:

| Topic | Linux `hidraw` | Windows HID/hidapi |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Device path | `/dev/hidrawN` discovered via sysfs | HID path returned by enumeration |
| Permissions | May require ACL/udev | Usually available to the user session |
| Feature report buffers | First byte is report ID | First byte is report ID |
| Input reports | Can read from hidraw file descriptor | Use HID read API |
| Output report `0x02` | `os.write()` works on hidraw | Use HID write/output report API |

Keep platform-specific code behind a small interface:

```python
class QuadroTransport:
    def get_feature_report(self, report_id: int, length: int) -> bytes: ...
    def set_feature_report(self, report: bytes) -> None: ...
    def write_output_report(self, report: bytes) -> None: ...
    def read_input_report(self, length: int, timeout_ms: int) -> bytes: ...
```

## Known Unknowns

These are not required for basic autonomous fan control but should stay visible:

| Area | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Vendor bulk endpoint format | Partially observed, not decoded. |
| Software sensor writes | Appear to use vendor bulk traffic and likely require host services. |
| Current and power live-unit scaling | Raw fields decoded but engineering units still unknown. |
| Flow scaling | Raw field decoded, calibration relationship not fully documented. |
| LED controller entry layout | Large area present in settings; only strip brightness/flags are currently useful. |
| Mode `4` details | Known to mean use/mirror another controller, but source mapping is not complete. |
| Firmware compatibility | Layout confirmed on firmware `1033`; plugin history references `1032`. |
